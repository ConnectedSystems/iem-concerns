10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.01.004,Ten iterative steps in development and evaluation of environmental models (2006),They are incorporating an ever broader range of disciplines and now often confront people without strong quantitative or model-building backgrounds.,Models are increasingly being relied upon to inform and support natural resource management.,"To this end the paper outlines ten basic steps of good, disciplined model practice.",,
10.1016/j.jhydrol.2003.12.010,A neuro-fuzzy computing technique for modeling hydrological time series (2004),The model showed good performance in terms of various statistical indices.,"It was observed that the ANFIS model preserves the potential of the ANN approach fully, and eases the model building process.","The results are highly promising, and a comparative analysis suggests that the proposed modeling approach outperforms ANNs and other traditional time series models in terms of computational speed, forecast errors, efficiency, peak flow estimation etc.",An introduction to the ANFIS modeling approach is also presented.,The results showed that the ANFIS forecasted flow series preserves the statistical properties of the original flow series.
10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.07.023,Categorising tools for sustainability assessment (2007),Discussion focuses on if and how the tools fulfil the objectives from the more current understanding of sustainability assessment.,The aim of this paper is to provide a categorisation of sustainability assessment tools within the broader objective of lifting the understanding of sustainability assessment from the environmental-focused realm to a wider interpretation of sustainability.,There is furthermore the overarching category of monetary valuation tools that can be used as a part of many of the tools listed in the three categories.,,
10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.12.003,Examining the global environmental impact of regional consumption activities - Part 2: Review of input-output models for the assessment of environmental impacts embodied in trade (2007),"Only then reliable figures for indicators of impacts embodied in trade, such as the Ecological Footprint, can be derived.",This has been made possible through improvements in data availability and quality as well as computability.,"A large number of such environment- economic models have been described but only in the last few years models have emerged that use a more sophisticated multi-region, multi-sector input-output framework.","Results from the reviewed studies demonstrate that it is important to explicitly consider the production recipe, land and energy use as well as emissions in a multi - region, multi-sector and multi-directional trade model with global coverage and detailed sector disaggregation.",we describe how to enumerate the resource and pollution content of inter-regional and inter-national trade flows with the aim to illustrate an ideal accounting and modelling framework for the estimation of Ecological Footprints.
10.1021/es0496524,"Biotic ligand model, a flexible tool for developing site-specific water quality guidelines for metals (2004)","Issues of concern include the arbitrary nature of LA() adjustments; possible mechanistic differences between daphnids and fish that may alter log K values, particularly for hardness cations (Ca+, Mg+); assumption of fixed biotic ligand characteristics in the face of evidence that they may change in response to acclimation and diet; difficulties in dealing with DOM and incorporating its heterogeneity into the modeling framework; and the paucity of validation exercises on natural water data sets.","In general, the greater the toxicity of a particular metal, the higher the log K. The BLM quantitatively relates short-term binding to acute toxicity, with the LA() (lethal accumulation) being predictive of the LC (generally  h for fish,  h for daphnids).","On the basis of fish gill research, the biotic ligands appear to be active ion uptake pathways (e.g., Na+ transporters for copper and silver, Ca+ transporters for zinc, cadmium, lead, and cobalt), whose geochernical characteristics (affinity = log K, capacity = B-max) can be quantified in short-term (- h) in vivo gill binding tests.","The model is flexible; all aspects of water chemistry that affect toxicity can be included, so the BLM integrates the concept of bioavailability into AWQC- in essence the computational equivalent of water effect ratio (WER) testing.","We critically evaluate currently available BLMs for copper, silver, zinc, and nickel and gill binding approaches for cadmium, lead, and cobalt on which BLMs could be based."
