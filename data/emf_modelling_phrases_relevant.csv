(2006),Two different methods for obtaining software programs with predictable quality are compared by positioning these models in a product/process and confirmation/improvement framework.,"The Mafteah/MethodA method can be placed in the confirmation segment, whereas the software Capability Maturity Model can be positioned in the improvement/process quadrant.",,,
No,10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.12.038,Determination of environmental flows in rivers using an integrated hydrological-hydrodynamic-habitat modelling approach (2018),"Calculations of the hydrodynamic-habitat model, in which the large and the small chub are the main fish species, suggest discharge values that range from 1.0 m(3)/s to 4.0 m(3)/s.","We propose the value of 1.0 m(3)/s as the ""optimum"" environmental flow for Sperchios River, because (a) it satisfies the habitat requirements, as expressed by the values of weighted useable area that are equal to 2180 and 1964 m(2) for the large and small chub, respectively, and correspond to 82 and 95% of their respective maximum values, (b) it is consistent with the requirements of Environmental Classes A and B, whose percentiles are higher than 75% for discharge (77.2%) and for habitat availability (>83.5% for the large chub and >85.0% for the small chub), (c) it is practically achievable from the hydrological point of view, and (d) it is higher than the value proposed by the Greek legislation.","Furthermore, legislation suggests significantly lower values (0.4-0.5 m(3)/s) that are unacceptable from the ecological point of view.","However, hydrological modelling indicates that it is practically difficult to achieve discharges that are higher than approximately 1.0-1.5 m(3)/s.","The proposed modelling approach can be applied to any river or stream using the same or similar modelling tools, which should be linked via suitable coupling algorithms."

Yes,10.1016/S1364-8152(97)00016-9,Delivering environmental decision support systems: software tools and techniques (1997),"A suite of ""desirable features"" for Environmental Decision Support Systems (EDSS) is proposed by identifying the general attributes of environmental systems which are of importance to modelling and simulation, and the different categories of users of EDSSs.","With these features as a guide, a review and discussion of the approaches to delivering Environmental Decision Support Systems is presented.","The review highlights the advantages and disadvantages of the two main approaches to EDSS delivery, and subsequently discusses the role emerging information technologies may play in the future delivery of EDSS.","The two most efficient approaches are: (i) the use of modelling and simulation software tools, and (ii) the use of model integration and re-use techniques.","The paper concludes that while the available software for modelling and simulation is very advanced, some of the desirable features of EDSS (such as representation of spatial data and provision of expert help) cannot be easily delivered using such software."
